Note to grader: although the [transition st] function in main.ml 
is over the 20 line limit, we believe this function is an exception. 
It is only long because of the extensive pattern matching it must perform on
each command, as well as the matching it must perform on each exception. 
Because the exception matching was wrapped inside the with portion of the 
try-with statement, it was difficult to put all the exception handling into a 
helper function. However, we have made this function as readable as possible 
with the use of many helper functions. The same reasoning can be applied to 
[parse] in Command.
